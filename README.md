# üö¢ Docker React Project

A production-friendly **React** setup containerized with **Docker**. It includes a separate Dockerfile for development (hot reload) and a production image to serve static assets.

> Goal: run the same app locally and in production with minimal friction.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dev container**: fast iteration with hot reload (`Dockerfile.dev` + `docker-compose.yml`).
- **Production image**: builds optimized static files and serves them (commonly via Nginx).
- **Clean context**: `.dockerignore` to keep images small and builds fast.
- **Zero global installs**: Node/Nginx live inside containers.

## üöÄ Quick start

### 1) Run in development (with Compose)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
# Then open http://localhost:3000  (or the port declared in docker-compose.yml)

Typical dev pattern:

Mount local source as a volume

Use a Node base image

Start the dev server (Vite/CRA) with hot reload

2) Build a production image
# Build
```
docker build -t react-app:prod .
```
# Run
```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 react-app:prod
```
# Visit http://localhost:8080

The production Dockerfile is set up to build static assets (npm ci && npm run build) and serve them (commonly with Nginx).
Prefer multi-stage builds to keep the final image small.

üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

Common NPM scripts:
```
npm run start     # local dev (outside Docker)
npm run build     # production build
npm run preview   # (if using Vite) serve build locally
```
‚öôÔ∏è Environment variables

React only exposes variables prefixed with REACT_APP_ (CRA) or VITE_ (Vite) at build time.
For runtime configuration, consider:

Injecting via Nginx env-subst

Fetching a /config.json generated at container start
